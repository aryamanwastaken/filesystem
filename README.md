MILESTONE 1 

For this milestone of the project we want your volume "formatted".

This means that you have a volume ready for use, so:

The Volume Control Block (block 0) is written,
The Free Space management is written, this should include the initialization of the free space, and at least the allocate procedure to allocate free space (release - to place allocated blocks back into the free space pool is not a requirement of this milestone).
The Root Directory is written and initialized with at least the "." and ".." entries
The submission for this assignment is the team github (the github of one of the members of the team that is being used as the central repository) and a PDF that has a cover page with your team name, each team member's name, and student ID# and the github name with your groups work.  The PDF should also have:

A dump (use the provided HexDump utility) of the volume file that shows the VCB, FreeSpace, and complete root directory.
A description of the VCB structure
A description of the Free Space structure
A description of the Directory system
A table of who worked on which components
How did your team work together, how often you met, how did you meet, how did you divide up the tasks.
A discussion of what issues you faced and how your team resolved them.
